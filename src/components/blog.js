        <div class="blog__heading">Health Benefits of Pomegranate Juice</div>
        <div class="blog__text">
          <p class="page-text">Fresh juice doesn't have to be green or full of spinach to be healthy. Pomegranate juice contains more than 100
          phytochemicals. The pomegranate fruit has been used for thousands of years as medicine.</p>
          <p class="page-text">Pomegranate seeds get their vibrant red hue from polyphenols. These chemicals are powerful antioxidants.
          Pomegranate juice contains higher levels of antioxidants than most other fruit juices. It also has three times more
          antioxidants than red wine and green tea. The antioxidants in pomegranate juice can help remove free radicals, protect
          cells from damage, and reduce inflammation.</p>
          <p class="page-text">The juice of a single pomegranate has more than 40 percent of your daily requirement of vitamin C. Vitamin C can be
          broken down when pasteurized, so opt for homemade or fresh pomegranate juice to get the most of the nutrient.</p>
          <p class="page-text">Pomegranate juice recently made a splash when researchers found that it may help stop the growth of prostate cancer
          cells. Despite multiple studies on the effects of the juice on prostate cancer, results are still preliminary.
          While there haven't been long-term studies with humans that prove that pomegranate juice prevents cancer or reduces the
          risk, adding it to your diet certainly can't hurt. There have been encouraging results in studies so far, and bigger
          studies are now being done.</p>
          <p class="page-text">
            Pomegranate juice can reduce inflammation in the gut and improve digestion. It may be beneficial for people with Crohn's
            disease, ulcerative colitis, and other inflammatory bowel diseases.
            
            While there are conflicting beliefs and research on whether pomegranate juice helps or worsens diarrhea, most doctors
            recommend avoiding it until you are feeling better and your symptoms have subsided.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            Pomegranate juice is in the running as the most heart-healthy juice. It appears to protect the heart and arteries.
            
            Small studies have shown that the juice improves blood flow and keeps the arteries from becoming stiff and thick. It may
            also slow the growth of plaque and buildup of cholesterol in the arteries. But pomegranate may react negatively with
            blood pressure and cholesterol medications like statins.
            
            Be sure to talk with your doctor before indulging in the juice or taking a pomegranate extract supplement.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            Pomegranate juice's concentration of antioxidants and ability to impact oxidative stress make it a potential fertility
            aid. Oxidative stress has been shown to cause sperm dysfunction and decrease fertility in women.
            
            The juice has also been shown to help reduce oxidative stress in the placenta. But researchers don't yet know the exact
            benefits this may provide. Drinking pomegranate juice can also increase testosterone levels in men and women, one of the
            main hormones behind sex drive.

        <div class="blog__heading">Health Benefits of Carrot Juice</div>
        <div class="blog__text">
          <p class="page-text">
            Carrots are an excellent source of vitamins, nutrients, and fiber. But you don’t have to eat carrots to receive these
            nutritional benefits. Drinking carrot juice is an easy way to add carrots to your diet. Here are eight reasons why you
            should add carrot juice to your diet.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">Since carrot juice is filling and low in calories, substituting this juice and ditching sodas and other sugary beverages
          can help you drop pounds faster.
          
          Carrot juice also increases bile secretion, which can increase metabolism — the rate at which your body converts energy
          into food. Bile is a fluid that breaks down fat. According to a studyTrusted Source from 2006, an increase in bile flow
          revved up the metabolism and increased weight loss in lab rats. It could produce a similar outcome in humans.</p>
          <p class="page-text">
            It’s often said that eating carrots is good for your eyes. It turns out there’s truth behind this claim. Carrot juice is
            a good source of beta-carotene, a type of vitamin A, which is one of the most powerful antioxidants.
            
            Vitamin A helps protect the surface of the eye and contributes to strong vision. Drinking carrot juice can ward off
            various eye disorders, such as macular degeneration, cataracts, and blindness. Carrots also contain lutein, which is an
            antioxidant that protects the eye from damaging light. A 1994 studyTrusted Source found that lutein was linked to a
            reduced risk for macular degeneration, an eye disorder that causes vision loss.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            A cold or the flu can stick around for one or two weeks, making it difficult (or impossible) to go to work or school. To
            strengthen your immune system and help your body fight off infections, add carrot juice to your daily diet and maintain
            your physical health.
            
            Carrots contain antioxidants, which help your body fight free radicals, cell damage, and inflammation. Vitamin C in
            carrot juice also provides an immune system boost, helping you get through cold and flu season.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            If you’re having trouble controlling your cholesterol, or if you want to control your cholesterol without medication,
            consider adding carrot juice to your diet. As an excellent source of potassium, carrot juice can help you maintain a
            healthy cholesterol level. Lower cholesterol levels reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. Talk to your doctor
            before stopping any prescription medications.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            Beta-carotene in carrot juice may also improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of age-related memory problems and
            dementia. Oxidative stress is linked to brain cell damage and occurs when brain and nerve cells can’t regenerate. This
            weakens nerve signaling and reduces cognitive function. However, beta-carotene in carrots may strengthen brain function
            and improve memory. In one studyTrusted Source, workers who were exposed to lead were treated with 10 milligrams of
            beta-carotene over a 12-week period. The study found that after treatment, the group receiving beta-carotene had less
            oxidative stress.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            While carrot juice has nutritional and health benefits, it’s important to drink in moderation. Fruit or vegetable juices
            contain little to no fiber, therefore they provide limited satiety and no bulk to the colon. Also, excessive intake of
            beta-carotene can potentially change the coloring of your skin. It’s this vitamin that gives carrot its orange color. If
            you eat or drink too many carrots or carrot juice, your skin may temporarily develop a slight yellowish or orange tint.

        <div class="blog__heading">Health Benefits of Orange Juice</div>
        <div class="blog__text">
          <p class="page-text">
            Some amazing benefits of Orange juice includes fortifies our immune system, improves digestive health, lowers the risk
            of cancer, protects the cardiovascular system, prevents kidney diseases, assists in weight loss, cleanses the skin,
            reduces wrinkles, improves eyesight, incredible healing properties, prevent hair loss, makes your hair beautiful, lower
            cholesterol levels, a natural anti-inflammatory, and provides nutrients during pregnancy.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            100% orange juice can help improve our immune systems through the high levels of Vitamin C. It is important to remember
            that a single serving offers up to the double of Vitamin C that our bodies need daily. So, in this case, a limited but
            regular intake is preferred.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            Orange juice has been part of diets and weight loss programs for a while. This is mainly due to the filling property of
            oranges. The juice has a sweet taste but has a low glycaemic index and fat content.
            
            These properties make it perfect for a snack when trying to follow a low-sugar diet. However, nutritionists suggest
            eating a whole orange rather than its juice. The squeezing process could lower the number of fibres that help in losing
            weight.
            
            Also, this could reduce the temptation of buying bottled orange juices that contain added sugar. This would be
            counterproductive in the process of losing weight.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            The anti-aging effects of anti-oxidants and citric acids have been proven through a large number of studies. Orange
            juice contains high levels of these nutrients and, through a regular intake, can reduce the visibility of wrinkles.
            Moreover, oranges are efficient in detoxing your body and skin from impurities and toxins.
            
            To enhance the anti-aging effects of orange juice, mix it with some other citrus fruits such as lemon or mandarin.
            Grapefruit and limes are also great options to change up your standard orange juice!
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            The benefits of Carotene and Vitamin A, both present in high levels in orange juice, have been studied over the years.
            Vitamin A is essential for good vision as it protects the cornea, the surface of the eye.
            
            Along with carotene, this vitamin is part of a larger group of antioxidants responsible for fortifying the immune
            system. Orange juice can help you strengthen the membrane of the eye and make it an effective barrier for bacteria or
            infections.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            Who said that you have to drink OJ to benefit from it? Just mix it up with some lemon juice and honey and you will have
            a natural homemade hair mask.
            
            This is shown to help with cleansing the scalp from dead skin cells, which would reduce dandruff. Also, natural hair
            masks will moisturize the hair and repair the damage caused by everyday stress.
